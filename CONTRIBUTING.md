## Running Tests

### SigSum Integration

For tests involving the SigSum integration, a SigSum server must be running in the background. You can start a local
SigSum server using the following command:

```sh
go run github.com/sigsum/sigsum-go/cmd/sigsum-log-server@v0.2.0 &
```

This project uses both unit tests to ensure code quality.
Please ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```sh
cargo test
