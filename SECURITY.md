# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

## Disclosure Policy

This project follows a policy of **immediate full disclosure**. We believe that full disclosure is the most effective 
way to ensure that vulnerabilities are fixed quickly and that users are informed of the risks.

When a vulnerability is reported, we will take the following steps:

1. **Confirm the vulnerability:** We will work to confirm the existence of the vulnerability and determine its impact.
2. **Develop a patch:** We will develop a patch to fix the vulnerability.
3. **Publicly disclose the vulnerability:** Once a patch is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability,
   along with the patch and details of the vulnerability. We will do this regardless of whether a CVE has been assigned.

We believe that this approach is in the best interest of our users and the Fediverse as a whole. 

We encourage security researchers to work with us to ensure that vulnerabilities are disclosed in a responsible and
timely manner.
